When running the snakemake, it will automatically determine what rules should be run in order to obtain a given target output(s).\nBuilding a snakemake workflow is very different, and even more challenging than the traditional method. In the past, we usually construct the workflow with a series of scripts and run it step by step. Therefore, we can easily connect the workflow by assigning the output of the current step as the input for the next step. However, the snakemake isn’t work like that. It somewhat works with a back-tracing manner - decide the final target first and look for rule that can create these outputs, and keep going upward until it reach the input(s) we currently have. Developer should also think backward when defining the rules. (i.e. defining the input name from the output) In other words, the snakemake workflow relies heavily on the file name and used it to determine what rules should be used. Since the workflow/rule order was decided automatically, developer also need to be cautious when defining the rules. Ambiguity will cause the failure of the workflow.

Although many splicing regulations around the exon/intron regions have been discovered, the relationship between promoter-bound transcription factors and the downstream alternative splicing remains largely unexplored. Results In this study, we present computational approaches to decipher the regulation relationship connecting the promoter-bound transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and the splicing patterns. We curated a fine data set, including DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing and transcriptome in fifteen human tissues from ENCODE. Specifically, we proposed different representations of TF binding context and splicing patterns to tackle the associations between the promoter and downstream splicing events. Our results demonstrated that the convolutional neural network (CNN) models learned from the TF binding changes in the promoter to predict the splicing pattern changes. Furthermore, through an in silico perturbation-based analysis of the CNN models, we identified several TFs that considerably reduced the model performance of splicing prediction. Conclusion In conclusion, our finding highlights the potential role of promoter-bound TFBSs in influencing the regulation of downstream splicing patterns and provides insights for discovering alternative splicing regulations.","tags":[],"title":"Predicting splicing patterns from the transcription factor binding sites in the promoter with deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"There are 2 major metagenomic approaches to investigate the microbiome - amplicon sequencing and shotgun sequencing.

For shotgun-based method, we can retrieve the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and further interrogate the functional capacity of them.\nCurrently, we apply metagenomic techniques to 2 ongoing projects - The citrus huanglongbing (HLB) project and elk coprophilous microbiome project.\nIn the citrus HLB project, we aim to find out how the citurs rhizosphere microbiome change during the HLB progression. It have been observed that the HLB-infected citrus trees suffered from root decline. In previous studies, we also confirmed that the HLB infection resulted in a different microbiome pattern in citrus rhizosphere. Our goal is to track the rhizosphere microbiome alteration and further looking for the functional changes during the HLB progression. Hopefully we will know more about the association between the rhizosphere microbiome and the HLB-related root decline symptom.\nIn the coprophilous microbiome project, we use the elk dung as a model system to observe the succession process. During the decomposition of dung, the microbiome utlize the nutrient resources and further change the nutritional condition and temperature, which in turn drive the succession of microbiome. The elk dung pellets were collected in a series of time points. The data was been analyse through both amplicon and shotgun approaches to reveal the populational change in coprophilous microbiome.\nSicne the shotgun metagenomic analysis usually contains several steps, we also developed a snakemake workflow to process the data.

The function of lncRNAs has been reported to play important roles in diverse biological processes, including developmental regulation and behavioral plasticity. However, there are no reports of systematic characterization of long non-coding RNAs in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of lncRNAs in the brains of S. invicta from RNA-seq. In total, 1,393 novel lncRNA transcripts were identified in the fire ant. In contrast to the annotated lncRNA transcripts having at least two exons, novel lncRNAs are monoexonic transcripts with a shorter length. Besides, the transcriptome from virgin alate and dealate mated queens were analyzed and compared. The results showed 295 differentially expressed mRNA genes (DEGs) and 65 differentially expressed lncRNA genes (DELs) between virgin and mated queens, of which 17 lncRNAs were highly expressed in the virgin alates and 47 lncRNAs were highly expressed in the mated dealates. By identifying the DEL:DEG pairs with a high association in their expression (Spearman’s |rho|\u003e 0.8 and p-value \u003c 0.01), many DELs were co-regulated with DEGs after mating. Furthermore, several remarkable lncRNAs (MSTRG.6523, MSTRG.588, and nc909) that were found to associate with particular coding genes may play important roles in the regulation of brain gene expression in reproductive transition in fire ants. This study provides the first genome-wide identification of S. invicta lncRNAs in the brains in different reproductive states. It will contribute to a fuller understanding of the transcriptional regulation underpinning reproductive changes.","tags":["Brain","Differential expression","lncRNA","RNA-seq"],"title":"Identification and comparative analysis of long non-coding RNAs in the brain of fire ant queens in two different reproductive states","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Intrinsically disodered regions (IDRs) are polypeptide segments which have flexible structure.

We calculated the IDP/peptide ratio and found they are varying between subphylum - Microsporidia has only 12.5% of the peptides are IDP but more than half of the peptides in Ustilaginomycotina contains IDRs.\nWe further investigate the relationship between IDP/peptide ratio and genome size and generate an interactive scatterplot to visualize the result. Currently we haven’t confirm any correlation between these 2 factors.\nOur goal is to find out the IDRs that have specific function but major obstacle is how to effectively filter out the non-functional ones. Since all the IDR predictions are rely on IUPred2 and might contain many false positives. One interference might be linker peptides that connect each functional domain. Any linker longer than 30 bp will be classified as an IDR but probably isn’t what we want. Therefore, we need a better way to filter out all these noises and we might have chances to target those functional IDRs.\n","date":1635197474,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635197474,"objectID":"494dfbd65ed7086c651c6aa450b7bd1b","permalink":"https://chtsai0105.github.io/project/idr_on_fungi/","publishdate":"2021-10-25T14:31:14-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/idr_on_fungi/","section":"project","summary":"Intrinsically disodered regions (IDRs) are polypeptide segments which have flexible structure.

However, current approaches to analyze genetic-perturbation screens are limited by their reliance on annotation libraries for prioritization of hits and subsequent targeted experimentation. Here, we present iTARGEX (identification of Trait-Associated Regulatory Genes via mixture regression using EXpectation maximization), an association framework with no requirement of a priori knowledge of gene function. After creating this tool, we used it to test associations between gene expression profiles and two biological traits in single-gene deletion budding yeast mutants, including transcription homeostasis during S phase and global protein turnover. For each trait, we discovered novel regulators without prior functional annotations. The functional effects of the novel candidates were then validated experimentally, providing solid evidence for their roles in the respective traits. Hence, we conclude that iTARGEX can reliably identify novel factors involved in given biological traits. As such, it is capable of converting genome-wide observations into causal gene function predictions. Further application of iTARGEX in other contexts is expected to facilitate the discovery of new regulators and provide observations for novel mechanistic hypotheses regarding different biological traits and phenotypes.","tags":[],"title":"iTARGEX analysis of yeast deletome reveals novel regulators of transcriptional buffering in S phase and protein turnover","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shin Yen Chong","Sam Cutler","Jing-Jer Lin","Cheng-Hung Tsai","Huai-Kuang Tsai","Sue Biggins","Toshio Tsukiyama","Yi-Chen Lo","Cheng-Fu Kao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683668384,"objectID":"befd4b1b9cc20b9e4d2fa6ce957c4a60","permalink":"https://chtsai0105.github.io/publication/chong-h-3-k-4-2020/","publishdate":"2023-05-09T21:39:44.06375Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-h-3-k-4-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) occur when intensive transcriptional activity compromises replication fork stability, potentially leading to gene mutations. Transcription-deposited H3K4 methylation (H3K4me) is associated with regions that are susceptible to TRCs; however, the interplay between H3K4me and TRCs is unknown. Here we show that H3K4me aggravates TRC-induced replication failure in checkpoint-defective cells, and the presence of methylated H3K4 slows down ongoing replication. Both S-phase checkpoint activity and H3K4me are crucial for faithful DNA synthesis under replication stress, especially in highly transcribed regions where the presence of H3K4me is highest and TRCs most often occur. H3K4me mitigates TRCs by decelerating ongoing replication, analogous to how speed bumps slow down cars. These findings establish the concept that H3K4me defines the transcriptional status of a genomic region and defends the genome from TRC-mediated replication stress and instability.","tags":["Chromatin","DNA replication","Epigenetics","Molecular biology","Transcription"],"title":"H3K4 methylation at active genes mitigates transcription-replication conflicts during replication stress","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://chtsai0105.github.io/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
