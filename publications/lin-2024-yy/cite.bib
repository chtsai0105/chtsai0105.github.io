 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing is a pivotal mechanism of
post-transcriptional modification that contributes to the
transcriptome plasticity and proteome diversity in metazoan
cells. Although many splicing regulations around the exon/intron
regions are known, the relationship between promoter-bound
transcription factors and the downstream alternative splicing
largely remains unexplored. RESULTS: In this study, we present
computational approaches to unravel the regulatory relationship
between promoter-bound transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)
and the splicing patterns. We curated a fine dataset that
includes DNase I hypersensitive site sequencing and
transcriptomes across fifteen human tissues from ENCODE.
Specifically, we proposed different representations of TF binding
context and splicing patterns to examine the associations between
the promoter and downstream splicing events. While machine
learning models demonstrated potential in predicting splicing
patterns based on TFBS occupancies, the limitations in the
generalization of predicting the splicing forms of singleton
genes across diverse tissues was observed with carefully
examination using different cross-validation methods. We further
investigated the association between alterations in individual
TFBS at promoters and shifts in exon splicing efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that the convolutional neural network (CNN)
models, trained on TF binding changes in the promoters, can
predict the changes in splicing patterns. Furthermore, a systemic
in silico substitutions analysis on the CNN models highlighted
several potential splicing regulators. Notably, using empirical
validation using K562 CTCFL shRNA knock-down data, we showed the
significant role of CTCFL in splicing regulation. CONCLUSION: In
conclusion, our finding highlights the potential role of
promoter-bound TFBSs in influencing the regulation of downstream
splicing patterns and provides insights for discovering
alternative splicing regulations.},
