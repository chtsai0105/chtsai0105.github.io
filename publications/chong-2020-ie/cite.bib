 abstract = {Transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) occur when intensive
transcriptional activity compromises replication fork stability,
potentially leading to gene mutations. Transcription-deposited
H3K4 methylation (H3K4me) is associated with regions that are
susceptible to TRCs; however, the interplay between H3K4me and
TRCs is unknown. Here we show that H3K4me aggravates TRC-induced
replication failure in checkpoint-defective cells, and the
presence of methylated H3K4 slows down ongoing replication. Both
S-phase checkpoint activity and H3K4me are crucial for faithful
DNA synthesis under replication stress, especially in highly
transcribed regions where the presence of H3K4me is highest and
TRCs most often occur. H3K4me mitigates TRCs by decelerating
ongoing replication, analogous to how speed bumps slow down cars.
These findings establish the concept that H3K4me defines the
transcriptional status of a genomic region and defends the genome
from TRC-mediated replication stress and instability.},
