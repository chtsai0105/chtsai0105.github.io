 abstract = {Rhodotorula, a red yeast genus inhabiting diverse environmental
and clinical niches, is a promising microbial source for
carotenoid and lipid production. Despite the coexistence of
sexual and asexual species, the evolutionary mechanisms
underlying their reproductive diversity remain poorly
understood. Here, we present a global genomic survey of 249
Rhodotorula strains using Oxford Nanopore, PacBio, and Illumina
sequencing. Phylogenomic analysis resolved a robust species
tree, delineating three major clades with substantial cryptic
species diversity. Chromosome-level assemblies revealed a
constrained tetrapolar mating system characterized by unlinked
pheromone/receptor (P/R) and homeodomain (HD) mating-type (MAT)
loci but displaying infrequent recombination. This genomic
architecture is widely conserved, even in species lacking
observed sexual cycles, suggesting widespread sexual potential.
The P/R locus functions as a supergene, exhibiting conserved
gene content and order within mating types but variable
configurations between compatible types. Clade-specific biases
in mating-type allele distributions indicates asymmetric
evolutionary pressures. Structural rearrangements and
trans-specific polymorphism of mating-specific allele at the
P/R locus, may drive sequence divergence, potentially
generating novel mating compatibility within the same mating
type. The intermediate P/R genomic states retaining pheromone
genes from the opposite mating type may preserve residual
functions or facilitate transitions in mating-type
architecture. Together with the presence of homozygous hybrid
strains, these genomic signatures suggest a potential shift
toward same-sex-like mating. Our findings elucidate how
mating-type architecture and allele dynamics underpin the
evolution of reproductive strategies in fungi and suggest that
innovations in MAT system may be a key evolutionary lever in
fungal adaptation across environments.},
