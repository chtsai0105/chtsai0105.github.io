 abstract = {Phyling is a fast, scalable, and user-friendly tool supporting
phylogenomic reconstruction of species phylogenies directly from
protein-encoded genomic data. It identifies orthologous genes by
searching a sample's protein sequences against a Hidden Markov
Models marker set, containing single-copy orthologs, retrieved
from the BUSCO database. In the final step, users can choose
between consensus and concatenation strategies to construct the
species tree from the aligned orthologs. Phyling efficiently
resolves large phylogenies by optimizing memory usage and data
processing. Its checkpoint system enables users to incrementally
add or remove samples without repeating the entire search process.
For analyses involving closely related taxa, Phyling supports the
use of nucleotide coding sequences, which may capture phylogenetic
signals missed by protein sequences. The benchmark results show
that Phyling substantially runs faster than OrthoFinder, a
Reciprocal Best Hit based method, while achieving equal or better
accuracy.},
