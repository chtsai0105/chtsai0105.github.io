 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been
extensively identified in higher eukaryotic species. The function
of lncRNAs has been reported to play important roles in diverse
biological processes, including developmental regulation and
behavioral plasticity. However, there are no reports of
systematic characterization of long non-coding RNAs in the fire
ant Solenopsis invicta. RESULTS: In this study, we performed a
genome-wide analysis of lncRNAs in the brains of S. invicta from
RNA-seq. In total, 1,393 novel lncRNA transcripts were identified
in the fire ant. In contrast to the annotated lncRNA transcripts
having at least two exons, novel lncRNAs are monoexonic
transcripts with a shorter length. Besides, the transcriptome
from virgin alate and dealate mated queens were analyzed and
compared. The results showed 295 differentially expressed mRNA
genes (DEGs) and 65 differentially expressed lncRNA genes (DELs)
between virgin and mated queens, of which 17 lncRNAs were highly
expressed in the virgin alates and 47 lncRNAs were highly
expressed in the mated dealates. By identifying the DEL:DEG pairs
with a high association in their expression (Spearman's |rho|>
0.8 and p-value < 0.01), many DELs were co-regulated with DEGs
after mating. Furthermore, several remarkable lncRNAs
(MSTRG.6523, MSTRG.588, and nc909) that were found to associate
with particular coding genes may play important roles in the
regulation of brain gene expression in reproductive transition in
fire ants. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first genome-wide
identification of S. invicta lncRNAs in the brains in different
reproductive states. It will contribute to a fuller understanding
of the transcriptional regulation underpinning reproductive
changes.},
