They often
lack of hydrophobic residues (which is the major driving component for protein folding) but enriched in
polar/charged residues (which enhance their capability to interact with water solvent). The characteristic
is used by some tools to predict the IDRs from a peptide sequence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this project, we collected the peptide sequences from 1,014 fungal species curated by Ensembl and got
over 8 millions predicted IDRs by the tools IUPred2. We calculated the IDP/peptide ratio and found they are
varying between subphylum - Microsporidia has only 12.5% of the peptides are IDP but more than half of the
peptides in Ustilaginomycotina contains IDRs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We further investigate the relationship between IDP/peptide ratio and genome size and generate an &lt;a href="scatterplot_IDP_ratio_groupby_subphylum.html">interactive
scatterplot&lt;/a> to visualize the result. Currently we haven&amp;rsquo;t
confirm any correlation between these 2 factors.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
